Raltp is a project we released after working on it for quite a while. Raltp stands for Réseau Alternatif Thématique Parisien which is a play on word with RATP, the authority of transportation in Paris and is basically a reappropriation of the metro network organized around themes to create an alternative to the existing one.

This was originally an idea of my friend Cedric who created this alternative network on paper and I offered to implement it on a website. This was for me the opportunity to play with backbone.js that I used to create the admin back-end of this for Cedric to manage the network. On the front-end part, I used my beloved leaflet.js mapping framework and of course some jQuery. I’m not a 100% satisfied yet with the way I did that part as it’s not very efficient performance-wise but I will update it. All the design element were created by Ben who also customized a mapbox map for the tiles.
